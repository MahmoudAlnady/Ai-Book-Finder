📚 LLM Semantic Book Recommender
An intelligent book recommendation system that understands natural language queries using Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic search. Just describe the kind of book you're looking for — and the system will do the rest.

🔍 Features
🧹 Data Cleaning & Exploration
Preprocessed messy book metadata to prepare it for downstream ML tasks.

🧠 Semantic Search with Vector Embeddings
Search books using natural queries like "a story about survival and hope" via vector-based similarity.

📊 Zero-Shot Text Classification
Automatically labels books as Fiction or Non-Fiction using LLMs without needing training data.

😮 Sentiment & Emotion Analysis
Understands the emotional tone of each book (joy, sadness, suspense...) to help users choose books by mood.

🌐 Gradio Web App
Clean and simple UI for end users to input queries and get meaningful recommendations instantly.
